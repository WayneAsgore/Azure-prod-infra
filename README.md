# Azure-prod-infra
With this project, I'm planning to recreate a production infrastructure in Azure

v1: 2025.06.23
First commit to my github repo. This is the v1 version of my Azure IaC deployment with Terraform. The deployment is working flawlessly but optimization and increasing efficency is needed. This README file will be constantly updated, alongside my commit history.

v2: 2025.06.25
After extensive testing and troubleshooting, my Terraform infastructure and Github Actions CI/CD pipeline is done. I'm planning to add remote state configuration, create further modularization, add more resources to my infrastructure, automate Ansible on my core VM. Further changes to CI/CD is also required
